# PP-You-Stream
YouStream is a simple platform that play audio directly from Youtube. Using a 3rd-party audio player inside the webbrowser to make sure that most modern browsers can use the platform without much maintanence. I made this little program back when Spotify locked down on Advertisement skipping. This was mostly done when I had other class work so if its a bit messy, thats because I didn't have much feel time to add progress or clean-up to the project.

# Libraries:
I used Youtubes-API to overall search listings under the category of Music, so not all videos will pop up. I had to manually install the Google SDK on my webserver and mess with my server permissions for around an hour to make sure everything would work nicely together without any security issues.

Like I mentioned above this uses a 3rd-party audio player(open source). This is because not only was it complete and serves its purpose but it also works on other browsers like Microsoft Edge, etc. Another reason is because it also saved me time since I didn't have much of it. You can find the un-modified version of this player on codepen.

# Try-it:
Overall my code is still working about a year later without maintanence and I'm still surprised. It may not be perfect but hey it serves its purpose.
